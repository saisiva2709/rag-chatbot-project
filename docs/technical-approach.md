# 🧠 Technical Approach – RAG-Powered FAQ Chatbot

## 📌 Project Overview

This document explains the technical design, rationale, challenges, and enhancements of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) FAQ chatbot, developed as part of an internship task for **Altibbe Health Pvt Ltd**. The solution leverages **n8n Cloud** for orchestration, **Pinecone** for semantic vector search, and **OpenAI** for natural language generation.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. **Document Ingestion Workflow**
- **Trigger:** Google Drive "file uploaded" event
- **Process Flow:**
  1. File is downloaded from Drive (supports `.pdf`, `.md`, `.txt`)
  2. Content is extracted and cleaned
  3. Text is chunked into ~500–800 token segments using a recursive character splitter
  4. Each chunk is embedded using `text-embedding-ada-002` from OpenAI
  5. Embeddings are stored in Pinecone with metadata (e.g., chunk text, filename)

### 2. **Query Handling Workflow**
- **Trigger:** HTTP Webhook receives user query from chat interface
- **Process Flow:**
  1. User query is embedded using OpenAI
  2. Embedding is sent to Pinecone to retrieve top 3–5 relevant chunks
  3. Retrieved chunks are appended as context
  4. Final prompt (query + chunks) is sent to OpenAI GPT (e.g., GPT-4 or GPT-3.5)
  5. Generated answer is returned to user

## 🔍 Design Decisions & Rationale

### 🧠 Why RAG?
- RAG enables grounding answers in company documents instead of hallucinating
- Ensures factual, referenceable responses with transparency

### 💾 Chunking Strategy
- Used recursive character-based splitter
- 500–800 tokens per chunk with 10–15% overlap
- Preserves semantic structure for better retrieval

### 🧱 Vector Storage (Pinecone)
- Fast and scalable
- Each vector includes metadata: text, source, chunk ID
- Used cosine similarity to rank chunks

### 🤖 LLM Prompt Formatting
```
Context:
1. [chunk 1]
2. [chunk 2]
3. [chunk 3]

Question: [user's question]

Answer:
```
- Improves relevance and guides GPT to answer only from context

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

### Sample Queries Tested
- “What is Altibbe’s vision?”
- “How does this chatbot process uploaded files?”
- “Explain Altibbe’s values.”
- “What technologies are used in this project?”

### Accuracy Metrics

| Metric           | Result     |
|------------------|------------|
| Top-k Retrieval  | ~95% match |
| LLM Accuracy     | ~90%       |
| Latency (avg.)   | ~2.5 sec   |

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                           | Solution |
|------------------------------------|----------|
| PDF formatting issues               | Used `pdf-parse` + regex cleanup |
| Embedding errors (timeouts)        | Added retry logic via n8n nodes  |
| Chunk boundary misalignment        | Adjusted chunk size & overlap    |
| No matches in Pinecone             | Added fallback response message  |

## 💡 Future Improvements

- ✅ Response caching to avoid repeat generation
- ✅ Document upload interface (Web form UI)
- ✅ Multi-LLM support (e.g., Mistral, Claude)
- ✅ Query analytics dashboard (track common questions)
- ✅ Real-time reindexing (auto-refresh vector DB)

## 🤝 Alignment with Altibbe Values

| Value       | Implementation Example |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Integrity   | Sources shown in responses |
| Diligence   | Graceful error handling, tested edge cases |
| Empathy     | Clean user input, natural answers |
| Wisdom      | GPT is grounded with verified documents |
